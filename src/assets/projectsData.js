    projectName: 'Nexter',
    projectDescription: 'The project is all about learning the grid layout in depth. It showcases the knowledge of how to position grid items, name the grid lines and areas, and align grid items and tracks. The minmax function assists in implementing responsive layouts that use auto-fill and auto-fit. The construction of grid template columns and rows using auto, min-, and max-content also involves the use of HTML and a Sass preprocessor. Throughout this course, I utilized Sass variables, functions, and mixins, which simplify the styling of the application, eliminate the need for dry code, and enable quick changes to style properties.',
