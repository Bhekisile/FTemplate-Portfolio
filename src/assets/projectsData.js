    projectName: 'Todo Vite TypeScript',
    projectDescription: 'This is a full-stack project demonstrating the use of TypeScript with ReactJS, ShadcnUI, Node.js, Express and MongoDB. From setting up TypeScript, instantiate a tsconfig.js file to advance use of TypeScript. In this course we touched everything about TypeScript, which includes interfaces, type aliases, enums, generics, tuples, abstract classes, access modifiers, type assertions, decorators, utility types, and dependency injection frameworks. We use a library called ZOD to validate the form and Tailwind for style.',

    projectName: 'Nexter',
    projectDescription: 'The project is all about learning the grid layout in depth. It showcases the knowledge of how to position grid items, name the grid lines and areas, and align grid items and tracks. The minmax function assists in implementing responsive layouts that use auto-fill and auto-fit. The construction of grid template columns and rows using auto, min-, and max-content also involves the use of HTML and a Sass preprocessor. Throughout this course, I utilized Sass variables, functions, and mixins, which simplify the styling of the application, eliminate the need for dry code, and enable quick changes to style properties.',
